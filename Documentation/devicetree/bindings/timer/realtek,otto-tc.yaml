title: Realtek Otto platform timer/counter bindings

description:
  "Up-counting 28-bit timer that can operate in oneshot or repeating mode,
  providing an interrupt at roll-over.

  The timer is driven by a divided clock, derived from the bus clock. The clock
  divisor is configurable from 2 to 65535. Divisor values of 0 and 1 disable
  the timer clock. The timer can also be enabled or disabled independently from
  the clock (divisor) selection.

  The number of timers supported by the different SoC families is:
  - RTL8380: 5 timers
  - RTL8390: 5 timers
  - RTL9300: 6 timers
  - RTL9310: 7 timers"
